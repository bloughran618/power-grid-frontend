# Power Grid Frontend

This is a prototype frontend to a power grid visualization application. This frontend is closely coupled with PowerGridParserBakend serverless application located at https://github.com/bloughran618/PowerGridParserBackend. 

Simply pull the code and run `npm start` to get started.

You can also view the webapp at https://main.d3m1js94dmjs8q.amplifyapp.com/ in the browser of your choice (or even on mobile :) )
